# BIP-Backend-Image-Processor
This is a small Web application that allows you to load any image file you want (supported file extensions for now: JPG/PNG), and automatically applies various filters on it, without redirecting or changing page.
Negative, Blurred, Sharpened, and Black'n'White versions of the uploaded image are returned to the user.
[Still on process]
