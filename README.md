# BIP-Backend-Image-Processor
<p>This is a small Web application that allows you to load any image file you want (supported file extensions for now: JPG/PNG), and automatically applies various filter effects on it, without redirecting or changing page.<br>
All of the filtered images are returned in the moment, allowing you to view and compare different versions of the selected image:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Original</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Negative</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Blur</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Sharpen</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Black and White</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Sepia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you like them, also you can save all the filtered images you want. And you can play with this all the times you want.</p>
